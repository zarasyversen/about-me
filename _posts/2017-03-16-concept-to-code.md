As a part of the [Spring Forward](http://wespringforward.com/){:target="_blank"} celebration, Ladies that UX and codebar Brighton came together for a night of collaboration called Concept to Code.

The workshop had a mix of web developers and UX designers at each table and it started with a lovely talk by Estelle Chung about her experiences as a UX designer working for IBM.

There was also a talk by [Benjamin Parry](https://twitter.com/benjaminparry/){:target="_blank"} about his transition from web developer to UX designer that was really interesting. After the talks, the designers and developers had to write down questions and we discussed it around the tables. 

One of my questions about UX was "How do you figure out a user's journey" and it was really useful to understand more about the user's experience of a product and also the importance of UX in our daily online experiences.

It was a great night and I hope there will be more collaborations between codebar &amp; Ladies that UX this year!
