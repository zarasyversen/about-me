What a lovely evening I had going to my first [SheSays Brighton](https://twitter.com/SheSaysBrighton){:target="_blank"} night! Organised by the amazing Rifa Thorpe -Tracey, it was about the future female in celebration of International Women's Day and held at the Sallis Benney Theatre.

The speakers were ([Lauren Currie](https://twitter.com/Redjotter){:target="_blank"}, [Imriel Morgan](https://twitter.com/@ImiMorgan){:target="_blank"}, [Samantha Kingston](https://twitter.com/K_Samantha1){:target="_blank"}, [Natalie D Kane](https://twitter.com/nd_kane){:target="_blank"} and [Bishi](https://twitter.com/witcih){:target="_blank"}. It was a great mixture of subjects from public speaking to VR to mi.mu gloves and every speaker had their own way to tell us their story.

All the speakers did a fantastic job and it was really inspiring! What I really enjoyed is Natalie sharing her path that led her to where she is today. Everyone's background is different and not everyone knows where they are going - and I think it is important to remind ourselves that nothing is ever set in stone.


I left the Sallis Benney Theatre feeling really inspired and powerful. I actually got a crazy idea in my head that I would like to be on that stage one day sharing my own story - but we shall see about that!
