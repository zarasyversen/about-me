One of the events I have been looking forward to the most was the Talent2017 job fair organised by WiredSussex! 
Basically a full day of workshops, talks and the possibility to chat to some amazing digital companies that participated in the day - a great opportunity for me as I am right now applying for my first job as a front end developer.

I planned out my schedule the day before and wrote down which workshops and talks I wanted to attend and made sure I had some time in between to chat with some companies. And what a day it was!

One of the talks I saw was "Make Website Better: Get into UX" by [Mat Walker](https://twitter.com/mat_walker){:target="_blank"} and [Penny Lunn](https://twitter.com/pennylunn){:target="_blank"} from The Unit. Really interesting to listen to as I am quite new to UX! Mat also shared some book tips that I will try and get my hands on to learn more about it.

Another great talk was by [Natalie Lloyd](https://twitter.com/natalie_l_lloyd){:target="_blank"} about Women in Tech. In this picture she is highlighting a few of the many incredible women in tech and I snapped this pic because one of Brighton's co-organisers for [codebar](https://codebar.io){:target="_blank"}  (and actually my first coach!), [Rosa Fox](https://twitter.com/rosaemerald){:target="_blank"} was featured.

And I was really happy to be able to support and cheer on 
[Chloe](https://twitter.com/Chloelangford){:target="_blank"} and [Vicki](https://twitter.com/varCompanion){:target="_blank"} 
from Gene Commerce on their first talk ever about their careers and climbing the digital ladder. 
I met Chloe for the first time at the end of January when Gene was hosting codebar and she kindly offered to help me (as a mentor sort of) with my projects and to get a job. She is a really talented and certified Magento frontend developer - and as I found out during their talk, just one of a handful women in the world!


Besides attending these talks, I was able to speak to some interesting companies, learn more about them, give out my CV and tell them more about myself. I got a few business cards that I made sure to send a follow-up email to the day after to thank them for their time and to keep me in mind if any opportunities come up.


Overall, I am really happy with the outcome of the day and at the end of the day, I had a massive smile on my face. 
I am normally not very good at networking but this time, I think it was easier to talk to new people because I am so passionate about web development and so eager to get started.  It also helped that some of the companies have hosted codebar before - so it was an easy way to get a conversation started.

Massive thanks to [Wired Sussex](http://www.wiredsussex.com/){:target="_blank"}  and the sponsors for making this day happen!
